[docs/](/docs): Files related to this github repo.

[exam/](/exam): Materials for creating a written pen&paper exam using the [exam LaTeX package](https://ctan.org/pkg/exam). An example mock exam is provided.

[files/](/files): General course files to be shared with students during the course.

[mandatory/](/mandatory): Materials for mandatory activities: coding test and home assignments. Not shared publicly.

`unit[XX]_[name]/`, where `[XX]` is `01`,..,`25`:  The 25 shared units. All files are shared with students, including contents of `files` and `reading` subfolders in advance, except for `.key` files which are used by the instructor to create the `.pdf` slides. A few units do not have an exercise. An additional unit 26 is a personalized lecture drawing from the instructor's own research and is not provided here. Additional units 27 and 28 have no materials as they are reserved for taking and discussing a mock exam, respectively.
