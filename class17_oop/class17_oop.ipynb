    "Polymorphism is the reason why `+` works for all combinations of data types where this operation is defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is no need to specify the type of the two input variables. The object `a` shall be able to \"add up\" with the object `b`. This is a very beautiful and simple implementation of the polymorphism concept. Python functions are polymorphic simply because they accept everything and trust the input data to be able to perform some actions."

    "This is exactly the problem that polymorphism wants to solve. We want to **describe an action regardless of the type of objects**, and this is what we do when we talk among humans. When you describe how to move an object by pushing it, you may explain it using a box, but you expect the person you are addressing to be able to repeat the action even if you need to move a pen, or a book, or a bottle."

    "### Polymorphism focuses on behavior and trusts the input\n",
    "Programming languages have two main strategies you can apply to get code that performs the same operation regardless of the input types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Cover all cases**, which is a typical approach of procedural languages like `C`. If you need to sum two numbers that can be integers, float or complex, you just need to write three functions, one bound to the integer type, the second bound to the float type and the third bound to the complex type, and to have some language feature that takes charge of choosing the correct implementation depending on the input type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Polymorphism**, as Python does: Simply require the input objects to solve the problem for you. In other words you _ask the data itself to perform the operation_, reversing the problem. Instead of writing a bunch of functions that add up all the possible types in every possible combination you just write one function that requires the input data to add up, trusting that they know how to do it."
