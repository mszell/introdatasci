    "# Machine Learning for Classification with SciKit-Learn\n",
    "Classification is the process of predicting the class (also called target or label) of given data points. In more technical terms, classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).  \n",
    "Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning, meaning we know know the true class labels of the data we are using to train our model, that is both X and y are given in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is binary classification since there are only 2 classes: spam and not spam.  \n",
    "The model utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In the email example case, known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to label new unknown emails."
